# Estimating Multivariate Models with brms

## Introduction

In the present vignette, we want to discuss how to specify multivariate
multilevel models using **brms**. We call a model *multivariate* if it
contains multiple response variables, each being predicted by its own
set of predictors. Consider an example from biology. Hadfield, Nutall,
Osorio, and Owens (2007) analyzed data of the Eurasian blue tit
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_blue_tit>). They predicted the
`tarsus` length as well as the `back` color of chicks. Half of the brood
were put into another `fosternest`, while the other half stayed in the
fosternest of their own `dam`. This allows to separate genetic from
environmental factors. Additionally, we have information about the
`hatchdate` and `sex` of the chicks (the latter being known for 94% of
the animals).

``` r

data("BTdata", package = "MCMCglmm")
head(BTdata)
```

## Basic Multivariate Models

We begin with a relatively simple multivariate normal model.

``` r

bform1 <- 
  bf(mvbind(tarsus, back) ~ sex + hatchdate + (1|p|fosternest) + (1|q|dam)) +
  set_rescor(TRUE)

fit1 <- brm(bform1, data = BTdata, chains = 2, cores = 2)
```

As can be seen in the model code, we have used `mvbind` notation to tell
**brms** that both `tarsus` and `back` are separate response variables.
The term `(1|p|fosternest)` indicates a varying intercept over
`fosternest`. By writing `|p|` in between we indicate that all varying
effects of `fosternest` should be modeled as correlated. This makes
sense since we actually have two model parts, one for `tarsus` and one
for `back`. The indicator `p` is arbitrary and can be replaced by other
symbols that comes into your mind (for details about the multilevel
syntax of **brms**, see
[`help("brmsformula")`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/brmsformula.md)
and `vignette("brms_multilevel")`). Similarly, the term `(1|q|dam)`
indicates correlated varying effects of the genetic mother of the
chicks. Alternatively, we could have also modeled the genetic
similarities through pedigrees and corresponding relatedness matrices,
but this is not the focus of this vignette (please see
[`vignette("brms_phylogenetics")`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/articles/brms_phylogenetics.md)).
The model results are readily summarized via

``` r

fit1 <- add_criterion(fit1, "loo")

    Draws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
    and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
    scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).

The summary output of multivariate models closely resembles those of
univariate models, except that the parameters now have the corresponding
response variable as prefix. Across dams, tarsus length and back color
seem to be negatively correlated, while across fosternests the opposite
is true. This indicates differential effects of genetic and
environmental factors on these two characteristics. Further, the small
residual correlation `rescor(tarsus, back)` on the bottom of the output
indicates that there is little unmodeled dependency between tarsus
length and back color. Although not necessary at this point, we have
already computed and stored the LOO information criterion of `fit1`,
which we will use for model comparisons. Next, let’s take a look at some
posterior-predictive checks, which give us a first impression of the
model fit.

``` r

pp_check(fit1, resp = "tarsus")
```

![](brms_multivariate_files/figure-html/pp_check1-1.png)

``` r

pp_check(fit1, resp = "back")
```

![](brms_multivariate_files/figure-html/pp_check1-2.png)

This looks pretty solid, but we notice a slight unmodeled left skewness
in the distribution of `tarsus`. We will come back to this later on.
Next, we want to investigate how much variation in the response
variables can be explained by our model and we use a Bayesian
generalization of the \\R^2\\ coefficient.

``` r

bayes_R2(fit1)
```

              Estimate Est.Error      Q2.5     Q97.5
    R2tarsus 0.4341278 0.0271826 0.3801776 0.4870575
    R2back   0.1987268 0.0285966 0.1433575 0.2552321

Clearly, there is much variation in both animal characteristics that we
can not explain, but apparently we can explain more of the variation in
tarsus length than in back color.

## More Complex Multivariate Models

Now, suppose we only want to control for `sex` in `tarsus` but not in
`back` and vice versa for `hatchdate`. Not that this is particular
reasonable for the present example, but it allows us to illustrate how
to specify different formulas for different response variables. We can
no longer use `mvbind` syntax and so we have to use a more verbose
approach:

``` r

bf_tarsus <- bf(tarsus ~ sex + (1|p|fosternest) + (1|q|dam))
bf_back <- bf(back ~ hatchdate + (1|p|fosternest) + (1|q|dam))
fit2 <- brm(bf_tarsus + bf_back + set_rescor(TRUE), 
            data = BTdata, chains = 2, cores = 2)
```

Note that we have literally *added* the two model parts via the `+`
operator, which is in this case equivalent to writing
`mvbf(bf_tarsus, bf_back)`. See
[`help("brmsformula")`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/brmsformula.md)
and
[`help("mvbrmsformula")`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/mvbrmsformula.md)
for more details about this syntax. Again, we summarize the model first.

``` r

fit2 <- add_criterion(fit2, "loo")
summary(fit2)
```

             mu = identity

Let’s find out, how model fit changed due to excluding certain effects
from the initial model:

Apparently, there is no noteworthy difference in the model fit.
Accordingly, we do not really need to model `sex` and `hatchdate` for
both response variables, but there is also no harm in including them (so
I would probably just include them).

To give you a glimpse of the capabilities of **brms**’ multivariate
syntax, we change our model in various directions at the same time.
Remember the slight left skewness of `tarsus`, which we will now model
by using the `skew_normal` family instead of the `gaussian` family.
Since we do not have a multivariate normal (or student-t) model,
anymore, estimating residual correlations is no longer possible. We make
this explicit using the `set_rescor` function. Further, we investigate
if the relationship of `back` and `hatchdate` is really linear as
previously assumed by fitting a non-linear spline of `hatchdate`. On top
of it, we model separate residual variances of `tarsus` for male and
female chicks.

``` r

bf_tarsus <- bf(tarsus ~ sex + (1|p|fosternest) + (1|q|dam)) +
  lf(sigma ~ 0 + sex) + skew_normal()
bf_back <- bf(back ~ s(hatchdate) + (1|p|fosternest) + (1|q|dam)) +
  gaussian()

fit3 <- brm(
  bf_tarsus + bf_back + set_rescor(FALSE),
  data = BTdata, chains = 2, cores = 2,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95)
)
```

Again, we summarize the model and look at some posterior-predictive
checks.

``` r

fit3 <- add_criterion(fit3, "loo")
summary(fit3)

    Draws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
    and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
    scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).

We see that the (log) residual standard deviation of `tarsus` is
somewhat larger for chicks whose sex could not be identified as compared
to male or female chicks. Further, we see from the negative `alpha`
(skewness) parameter of `tarsus` that the residuals are indeed slightly
left-skewed. Lastly, running

``` r

conditional_effects(fit3, "hatchdate", resp = "back")
```

![](brms_multivariate_files/figure-html/me3-1.png)

reveals a non-linear relationship of `hatchdate` on the `back` color,
which seems to change in waves over the course of the hatch dates.

There are many more modeling options for multivariate models, which are
not discussed in this vignette. Examples include autocorrelation
structures, Gaussian processes, or explicit non-linear predictors (e.g.,
see
[`help("brmsformula")`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/brmsformula.md)
or `vignette("brms_multilevel")`). In fact, nearly all the flexibility
of univariate models is retained in multivariate models.
